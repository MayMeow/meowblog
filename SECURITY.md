# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability
Security is our top priority at **MayMeow HQ**. If you discover a security vulnerability in any of our projects, please report it responsibly by following these guidelines:

1. **Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly** until we have had a chance to address them.
2. **Report the issue privately** via email at [security@maymeow.dev](mailto:security@maymeow.dev).
3. **Provide detailed information** including steps to reproduce, potential impact, and suggested fixes if possible.
4. **Give us time to respond** – we will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and work on a resolution as quickly as possible.

## 🔒 Supported Versions
We actively maintain the latest major versions of our projects. Security fixes will be backported where possible, but we strongly encourage users to stay up to date with the latest releases.

| Version | Supported  |
|---------|------------|
| Latest  | ✅ Active Support |
| Older Releases | ⚠️ Limited Support |

## 📜 Responsible Disclosure
We appreciate responsible disclosures and will acknowledge contributors who report valid security issues. If you responsibly report a security issue, we may credit you in the security advisory unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

Thank you for helping keep **MayMeow HQ** and its users secure! 🐱🔐
